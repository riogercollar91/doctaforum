== Usage and Options ==

Use this plugin, is very easy, you can use it quickly after install it. To do that, you need to use this shortcode:

[countup start="your-value" end="your-value" decimals="your-value" duration="your-value"]

** VERSION 2.0 **

Also you can add the options from CountUP.js Options Page inside of the shortcode, like this:

[countup easing="true" groupig="false" separator="," decimal="." prefix="this_prefix" suffix="this_suffix"]

If you don't use these options inside of the shortcode, the default values will be pull from CountUp.js Options Page.

** END VERSION 2.0 **

** VERSION 2.1 **

All counters started their animation before to reach the target counter. Now, when you scrolled to the target counter, the counter will start their animation.

** END VERSION 2.1 **

Value = true or false.

** END VERSION 2.2 **

** END VERSION 2.3 **

** VERSION 3.0 **

Now, you could choose how to use the shortcode:

NEW: [countup start="0" more_options_here]55[/countup] or the old one:
[countup start="0" end="55"]

If you want to use the first one, you should activate the "Use the end number inside the shortcode?"
option.

The shortcode accepts those arguments, as you can see previously:

  end="your-value" //This use a number to end the counter at.
  decimals="your-value" //This use a number to put decimals to your counter.
  duration="your-value" //This use a number (seconds) as duration of the counter.
  scroll="your-value" //Load counter when the page is loaded. Default Value: True.
]

[countup start="0" end="55" decimals="0" duration="5" prefix="my_prefix" scroll="false"]

  duration="your-value" //This use a number (seconds) as duration of the counter.
  scroll="your-value" //Load counter when the page is loaded. Default Value: True.
]your-end-number[/countup]
